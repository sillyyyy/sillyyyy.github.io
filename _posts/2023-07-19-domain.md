# I bought a Domain Name!

Hey, after 5 days, purchased this domain name for free as of now for a year. Will change it or renew it in the future :)

And you know what, the real struggle was selecting a name lol, there were many options but I needed a short one because of the ease and the point that the domain names are made to remember it (according to me) and not to be long & make it more boring. And if you are finalising a long name or a name that is not memorable then bruh there should no concept of the DNS system and instead people would be sharing IP addresses to each other.

For now you prolly redirected from github or found me at 'iprajanya.tech'. Maybe I'll change it to:

* iprajanya.com
* iprajanya.me
* iprajanya.xyz

Let's see how it goes. Also, there'll be some good news soon :0 

I guess that's it for now.
Seeya peeps. \*<3\*
