# Welcome!

Hi to anyone who's reading this, this post marks the birth of this website, I just wanted to have one website like this for public but didn't have the time to publish earlier. Here you go! 

This website has been hosted on github as of now, future plans include buying a proper domain name for it.

You're always welcome for suggestions related to this site.

I guess that's it for now.
